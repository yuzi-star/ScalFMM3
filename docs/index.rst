scalfmm3 : A generic fast multipole method library
==================================================

ScalFMM is a software/library to simulate N-body interactions using the Fast Multipole Method.
This is a kernel independent fast multipole method based on interpolation (Chebyshev or Lagrange).
Its genericity allows the user to write new kernels and easily extend the library.
